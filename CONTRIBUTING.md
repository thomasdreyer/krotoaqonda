## Ways to help

- **Report issues:** Open a GitHub issue with clear steps to reproduce and expected behavior.

## Development setup

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch:

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and scoped to a single change.

- Update documentation or comments when behavior changes.
- Ensure the prototype still runs locally before submitting.

## Code style

- Favor clear, readable HTML/CSS/JS.
- Keep changes consistent with existing formatting.
